# A-Path-Finding-Visualiser
Built using pygame 

Watch the astar pathfinding algorithm in action as well as showing you all the possible open nodes and closed nodes as it recursively trys to find the shortest path from the start node to the end node. Uses a Priority Queue to keep track of the list of open nodes.
